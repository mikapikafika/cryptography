# The goal of this project was to implement the AES encryption algorithm and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) in an application with a user-friendly graphical interface.
## The user is able to:
- generate or load a cipher key from a file
- encode a file using the AES algorithm
- decode a file
- sign file with DSA and verify signature
