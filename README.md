<h1 align="center" id="title">Cryptography Project</h1>

<p id="description">The goal of this project was to implement the AES encryption algorithm and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) in an application with a user-friendly graphical interface.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   generating or loading a cipher key from file
*   encoding a file using the AES algorithm
*   decoding a file
*   signing a file with DSA and verifying the signature

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Ensure you have Java installed (this project uses Java 17).</p>

<p>2. To build the project you can use the provided Maven wrapper scripts:</p>
<p>On Unix-based systems:</p>
